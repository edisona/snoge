# sensors: A space separated list of "locations" where a sensor is to be placed on the map. Location is specified by IP address, the geoip DB will map this to somewhere in the world.

# basefilename: The name of the unified alert file that is to be processed. Unified files have a epoch timestamp appended to them, don't specify that timestamp, the code will work it out. If you do want to process a specific file, take a look at the command line "-o" argument.

# classification: Location of the classification.config file. This contains human readable classtype mappings and priority data.

# imageurl: Where can your image files be found? Images include event icons, and banner

# sensoricon: What icon would you like used for the sensor placemarks. This file name will be appended to the image url

# eventicon: What icon would you like used for your event placemarks. This file name will be appended to the image url
eventicon="warning.png"

# waldo: Location of a waldo file. This should be different to any other waldos you already have for barnyard, tweetyard, etc. This file is used to track what events have been already processed and plotted.
