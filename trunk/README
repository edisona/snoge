Hello.

Unfortunately little-to-no documentation for Snoge, smart people should be able to get by focusing on the error messages and the verbose .conf file.
Take a look at leonward.wordpress.com/snoge for other hints and tips.

TODO:
	- Add event filtering for estreamer
	- Add impact flag styles rather than numeric values
	- Documentation
	- Clean up variable names
